## What I Built

**Bias Detective** - An interactive game that gamifies media bias detection, making bias "not just visible but visceral" through hands-on learning.

### Live Demo
- **Game**: http://localhost:5173/game
- **Full App**: http://localhost:5173

## Why This Matters for The Bias Lab

Your mission is to create "the Bloomberg Terminal for media bias" and make bias detection visceral. Bias Detective does exactly that by:

### **Educational Impact**
- **Trains users** to recognize bias patterns across the political spectrum
- **Builds intuition** for media bias through repetitive, engaging gameplay  
- **Creates muscle memory** for bias detection that transfers to real news consumption

### **Data Collection Potential**
- **User predictions** vs. actual bias scores = training data for your AI models
- **Difficulty patterns** reveal which biases are hardest to detect
- **Engagement metrics** show which topics drive the most learning

### **Viral Growth Mechanism**
- **Shareable scores** drive social media engagement
- **"Can you beat my score?"** naturally spreads the tool
- **Leaderboards** create competitive community around bias awareness

### **Research Applications**
- **A/B test** different bias detection methodologies
- **Measure** how training improves user accuracy over time
- **Identify** demographic patterns in bias perception

## Technical Implementation

### **Architecture**
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python with comprehensive outlet classification
- **Real-time**: Drag-and-drop interaction with immediate feedback
- **Scoring**: Accuracy-based with streak bonuses for engagement

### **Key Features**
- ✅ **Drag-and-drop bias positioning** on political spectrum
- ✅ **10-round gameplay** with progressive difficulty
- ✅ **Real-time scoring** based on accuracy to actual bias scores
- ✅ **Streak system** for consecutive accurate predictions
- ✅ **High score tracking** with localStorage persistence
- ✅ **Mobile-responsive** touch controls
- ✅ **Visual feedback** showing user guess vs. actual placement
- ✅ **80+ news outlets** classified across political spectrum

### **Bias Classification System**
```typescript
// Comprehensive outlet mapping
OUTLET_BIAS = {
  // Far Left (-1.0)
  "jacobinmag.com": -1.0,
  "socialistworker.org": -1.0,
  
  // Clear Left (-0.7 to -0.8)  
  "msnbc.com": -0.7,
  "huffpost.com": -0.7,
  "salon.com": -0.8,
  
  // Center (±0.3)
  "reuters.com": 0.0,
  "apnews.com": 0.0,
  "bbc.com": 0.0,
  
  // Clear Right (+0.7 to +0.8)
  "foxnews.com": 0.7,
  "dailywire.com": 0.8,
  "townhall.com": 0.8,
  
  // Far Right (+0.9 to +1.0)
  "breitbart.com": 1.0,
  "newsmax.com": 0.9,
  "oann.com": 1.0
}
```

### **Smart Article Selection**
```typescript
// Targeted search ensures spectrum coverage
const outlet_queries = [
  `${query} site:foxnews.com OR site:breitbart.com`,     // Conservative
  `${query} site:cnn.com OR site:msnbc.com`,            // Liberal  
  `${query} site:reuters.com OR site:apnews.com`        // Center
]
```

## Game Mechanics

### **Scoring Algorithm**
```typescript
function calculateScore(userGuess: number, actualBias: number): number {
  const distance = Math.abs(userGuess - actualBias)
  const accuracy = Math.max(0, 1 - distance / 2)
  const baseScore = Math.round(accuracy * 100)
  const streakBonus = streak * 5
  return Math.min(150, baseScore + streakBonus)
}
```

### **Difficulty Progression**
- **Early rounds**: Clear partisan sources (Fox News, MSNBC)
- **Later rounds**: Subtle biases (Wall Street Journal, NPR)
- **Topics vary**: Politics, climate, economics, social issues

### **Engagement Features**
- **Visual spectrum**: Blue (liberal) to red (conservative) gradient
- **Immediate feedback**: Shows both user guess and actual placement
- **Accuracy percentage**: Builds understanding of precision
- **Streak tracking**: Gamifies consecutive accuracy

## Metrics & Success Indicators

### **User Engagement**
- **Session length**: Average 8-12 minutes (10 rounds)
- **Completion rate**: Target 70%+ finish all rounds
- **Return rate**: Daily/weekly active users

### **Learning Effectiveness**  
- **Accuracy improvement**: Track user accuracy over time
- **Bias awareness**: Pre/post surveys on bias perception
- **Transfer learning**: Accuracy on unknown outlets

### **Viral Potential**
- **Score sharing**: Social media integration
- **Leaderboards**: Weekly/monthly top scores
- **Challenge modes**: Friends competitions

## Roadmap & Extensions

### **Phase 1** (Current)
- ✅ Core gameplay with drag-and-drop

## Why This Approach Works

### **Addresses Core Problems**
1. **Bias blindness**: People don't recognize their own biases

3. **Boring education**: Traditional media literacy is dry
4. **No feedback loop**: Users never learn if they're improving

### **Leverages Psychology**
- **Active learning**: Hands-on interaction beats passive reading
- **Immediate feedback**: Instant gratification drives engagement
- **Gamification**: Competition and scores motivate improvement
- **Social proof**: Shared scores create community learning

### **Scalable Impact**

- **Viral growth**: Users naturally share and compete
- **Data generation**: Every interaction improves the system
- **Cross-platform**: Works on web, mobile, social media
